# PHP_Login_and_Register_with_mySQL
I made a login and registration system using MySQL connection with PHP in this repository.

You can examine the database structure by importing the `phploginregister.sql` via phpmyadmin. After the import process is completed, edit the `connect.php` file according to yourself.
